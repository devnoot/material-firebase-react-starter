# noot-stack

## Overview

Noot stack is a frontend stack that contains the following tools and libraries

- React
- Parcel bundler
- Typescript
- Material UI

In each folder under `src/` there is a `readme.md` file containing guidance about how files under the containing folder should be structured.

These guidelines are modeled such that code pieces can be grouped by similarity while still being named and exported in a clean and standardized fashion.
